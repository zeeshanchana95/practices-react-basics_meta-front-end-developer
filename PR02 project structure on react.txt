==> Project Structure:
1. node_modules:
It is repository for all the modules in the React App.
Automatically get installed when user install npm package

2. public:
- It contains assets that will be displayed in the user app
- robots.txt: used for search engine optimization
- favicon.ico: used to show icons in the browser search bar
- manifest.json: provide metadata to a device when React-powered web app is installed on it.
- index.html:  A React app gets injected into the specific elements inside the body of the index HTML file. Based on changes happening inside our React app, it injects those updates in that same div of index HTML.

3. src: 
- This folder contains all the essential component files required to ensure that a React app functions.
- Index.js and App.js: use to render the root components of the app
- App.css: contains the styles of App.js component.
- index.css: contains the styles used in the whole app
- App.test.js, setupTests.js, reportWebVitals.js: contains information related to app performance and testing
- logo.svg: displayed on the default page of the app

Among all the files, the most important one is Index.js file. It imports everything that React app needs to render or working react

4. Root files: 
- .gitignore: 
The .gitignore file is using version control and it's used to specify what files and folders must be excluded from a project. It's important to note that this file is not specific to React. This means that other systems use this file too. 

- REDME.md: 
The README.md file is a markdown file that gives some basic information on this project. Developers use this when they want to share the project's code on sites like GitHub. 

- package.json: 
The package.json file lists information pertaining to my app, which allows npm to run several scripts and perform various tasks in the app itself. 

- package-lock.json: 
Finally, the package-loc.json file holds the list of all dependencies with a specific versions. The package.json file helps npm rebuild the app on another machine. Or if we delete the node modules folder with all the files that our project needs to run, the package-loc.json file has all the information for npm to be able to rebuild those files reliably. This file is there to ensure the npm tracks all the modules installations properly.

As a general rule, it's better to leave these files where they offer the moment as they are required for the app to function.
